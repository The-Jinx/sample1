            <p><b><a href ="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/48860">Once</a> upon a midnight dreary</b>, while I <i>pondered</i>, weak and weary,<br> Over <strong>many a quaint and curious</strong> volume of forgotten lore—<br> While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br> As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br> “’<em>Tis some visitor</em>,” I muttered, “<em>tapping at my chamber door— <br> <small>Only this and nothing more</small></em>.” </p> 
           <p> Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br> 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br> 
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br> 
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br> 
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br> 
            Nameless here for evermore.  </p>
            <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br> 
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br> 
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br> 
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br> 
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br> 
            This it is and nothing more.” &#169; <mark>E.A.Poe</mark></p>
